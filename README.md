===========

HaxFootball's league database wordpress plugin.

This is a very simple php object oriented league management system that can be installed on various wordpress sites.
It's completely customizable for stats, please modify the Stats.php to fit a certain model.

A sample implementation can be found at http://www.haxfb.com

I'm making this open source so that various other game sites can easily modify it to fit their needs.
